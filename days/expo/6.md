# Day 6: Async JS & TypeScript (I) - Callbacks and Introduction to Promises

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Synchronous vs. Asynchronous JavaScript:** Revisit the concepts of blocking and non-blocking code execution in the context of JavaScript.
2.  **Explore Callbacks:** Learn how callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
3.  **Identify "Callback Hell":** Understand the problems that can arise from deeply nested callbacks.
4.  **Introduction to Promises:** Get a high-level overview of Promises as a solution to managing asynchronous operations more effectively.

## 📖 Task Explanations

JavaScript, by nature, is single-threaded. This means it can only execute one piece of code at a time. However, many operations, like fetching data from a server or reading a file, take time. If JavaScript waited for these operations to complete, the entire application would freeze. This is where asynchronous programming comes in.

Historically, callbacks were the primary way to handle asynchronous code. A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed when the asynchronous operation completes. While effective, deeply nested callbacks can lead to code that is hard to read and maintain, often referred to as "callback hell."

Today, you'll understand this problem and be introduced to Promises, a modern JavaScript feature designed to provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations, paving the way for more readable and manageable code.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a clear understanding of synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript execution. You'll recognize the challenges of callback-based asynchronous code and appreciate how Promises offer a more elegant solution. This foundational knowledge is crucial for building responsive React Native applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Synchronous JavaScript:** Code that executes sequentially, one operation completing before the next one starts.
*   **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Code that allows operations to run in the background without blocking the main execution thread, typically handled by callbacks, Promises, or `async/await`.
*   **Callback:** A function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
*   **Callback Hell (Pyramid of Doom):** A phenomenon that occurs when multiple nested asynchronous operations using callbacks make the code difficult to read and maintain.
*   **Promise:** An object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
