# Day 12: TypeScript (II) & Adv. JS - Custom Types and Type Aliases

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Type Aliases (`type` keyword):** Learn how to create new names for existing types or define complex types using the `type` keyword.
2.  **Work with Union Types:** Learn how to combine multiple types into one, allowing a variable to hold values of any of the combined types (e.g., `string | number`).
3.  **Explore Intersection Types:** Understand how to combine multiple types into one, requiring a variable to have all properties of all combined types (e.g., `TypeA & TypeB`).
4.  **Use Literal Types:** Learn how to define types that are specific string, number, or boolean literals (e.g., `'red' | 'green' | 'blue'`).

## 📖 Task Explanations

While interfaces are great for defining the shape of objects, TypeScript offers even more flexibility with type aliases and advanced type combinations. Type aliases, created with the `type` keyword, allow you to give a new name to any type, whether it's a primitive, an object shape, or a complex combination of other types. This can significantly improve the readability and maintainability of your type definitions.

Union types (`|`) let you declare that a variable can be one of several types, which is incredibly useful for handling data that might come in different forms. Intersection types (`&`) allow you to combine multiple types into a single type that has all the properties of the combined types. Literal types enable you to restrict a variable to a very specific set of values, making your types even more precise.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create highly flexible and expressive type definitions using type aliases, union types, intersection types, and literal types. This will empower you to model complex data structures accurately and write even more robust and type-safe JavaScript code for your React Native projects.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Type Alias:** A new name for an existing type or a way to define a complex type using the `type` keyword.
*   **Union Type:** A type that allows a variable to hold values of one of several specified types. Denoted by `|`.
*   **Intersection Type:** A type that combines multiple types into one, requiring a variable to have all properties of all combined types. Denoted by `&`.
*   **Literal Type:** A type that represents a specific string, number, or boolean value, rather than a general type.
