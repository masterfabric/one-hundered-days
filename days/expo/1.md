# Day 1: JavaScript (ES6+) Fundamentals - Variables and Basic Syntax

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Set up your JavaScript Development Environment:** Ensure you have Node.js installed to run JavaScript outside a browser, and a code editor like VS Code.
2.  **Understand `var`, `let`, and `const`:** Learn the differences between these keywords for declaring variables and when to use each.
3.  **Explore JavaScript Data Types:** Get familiar with primitive data types (String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt) and object types.
4.  **Work with Operators:** Practice using arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today marks the beginning of your journey into JavaScript, the language that powers much of the web and, crucially, React Native. Setting up your environment is key; Node.js allows you to execute JavaScript code directly, which is essential for development tools. You'll dive into variable declaration, understanding the modern `let` and `const` keywords that largely supersede `var` due to their improved scoping rules.

Understanding JavaScript's data types is fundamental to manipulating information. You'll also learn how to perform operations on these data types using various operators, which are the building blocks of any logic you'll write.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a functional JavaScript development setup and a solid grasp of modern JavaScript variable declaration, fundamental data types, and operators. This foundational knowledge is crucial for writing any JavaScript code, especially for React Native development.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing JavaScript to run on the server-side and for command-line tools.
*   **`var`:** An older keyword for declaring variables, known for its function-scoping behavior.
*   **`let`:** A modern keyword for declaring block-scoped variables, which can be reassigned.
*   **`const`:** A modern keyword for declaring block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial declaration.
*   **Data Types:** Classifications that specify which type of value a variable can hold (e.g., String, Number, Boolean).
*   **Operators:** Symbols that perform operations on values and variables (e.g., `+`, `-`, `=`, `==`, `&&`).
