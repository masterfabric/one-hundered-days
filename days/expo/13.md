# Day 13: TypeScript (II) & Adv. JS - Advanced Array Methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand `Array.prototype.map()`:** Learn how to use `map` to create a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array.
2.  **Understand `Array.prototype.filter()`:** Learn how to use `filter` to create a new array containing only the elements that satisfy a provided condition.
3.  **Understand `Array.prototype.reduce()`:** Learn how to use `reduce` to apply a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.
4.  **Practice Chaining Methods:** Combine `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to perform complex data transformations in a single, readable chain.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll unlock the power of functional programming in JavaScript by mastering three essential array methods: `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. These methods allow you to transform and manipulate arrays in a declarative and highly efficient way, often replacing traditional `for` loops with more concise and readable code.

`map` is perfect for transforming each item in an array into something new. `filter` is your go-to for selecting a subset of items based on a condition. `reduce` is the most versatile, allowing you to boil down an entire array into a single value, whether it's a sum, an object, or anything else. Learning to chain these methods together will enable you to perform complex data operations with remarkable elegance.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to manipulate arrays with greater efficiency and readability using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. These methods are fundamental in modern JavaScript development, especially in React Native, for handling data transformations from APIs or user interactions. Your code will become more concise, expressive, and easier to debug.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`map()`:** An array method that creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
*   **`filter()`:** An array method that creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
*   **`reduce()`:** An array method that executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
