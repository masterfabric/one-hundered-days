# Day 20: React Basics & Hooks - Practice Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a simple interactive application using functional components, props, `useState`, and `useEffect`.
2.  **Choose one of the following:**
    *   **Counter App:** A simple app with a display for a number and two buttons to increment and decrement it. (Use `useState`)
    *   **Basic To-Do List:** An app where you can add new to-do items and display them in a list. (Use `useState` for the list, props for individual items)
    *   **Simple Form:** A form with one or two input fields (e.g., name, email) and a submit button. Display the input values after submission. (Use `useState` for input values, `useEffect` for form submission side effects).
3.  **Component Structure:** Break down your chosen app into logical functional components.
4.  **TypeScript Integration:** Ensure all props and state variables are type-safe using TypeScript interfaces.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is your opportunity to consolidate all the React basics you've learned over the past few days. By building a small, self-contained application, you'll gain hands-on experience in combining functional components, passing data with props, managing component state with `useState`, and handling side effects with `useEffect`.

This practice project is crucial for solidifying your understanding of React's component-based architecture and how to build interactive user interfaces. Don't be afraid to experiment and refer back to previous days' notes. The goal is to apply your knowledge and build something functional.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have practical experience in building a complete, interactive React application. You will have a deeper understanding of how to combine React Hooks and TypeScript to create robust and dynamic user interfaces. This project will serve as a strong foundation for your upcoming React Native development.

*   **Review of Previous Terms:**
    *   **Functional Component:** A JavaScript function that returns JSX.
    *   **Props:** Data passed from parent to child components.
    *   **`useState` Hook:** Manages component-specific state.
    *   **`useEffect` Hook:** Manages side effects and lifecycle events.
    *   **TypeScript Interface:** Defines the shape of objects and props for type-safety.
