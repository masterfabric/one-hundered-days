# Day 4: JavaScript (ES6+) Fundamentals - Spread/Rest Operators and Destructuring

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand the Spread Operator (`...`):** Learn how to use the spread operator to expand iterables (like arrays or strings) into individual elements.
2.  **Apply the Spread Operator:** Practice using it to combine arrays, copy arrays, and pass elements as arguments to functions.
3.  **Understand the Rest Operator (`...`):** Learn how the rest operator collects multiple elements into an array.
4.  **Implement Array Destructuring:** Learn how to extract values from arrays into distinct variables using destructuring assignment.
5.  **Implement Object Destructuring:** Learn how to extract properties from objects into distinct variables using destructuring assignment.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll dive into some of the most powerful and frequently used ES6 features that make JavaScript code more concise and readable: the spread/rest operators and destructuring. These features are incredibly useful when working with arrays and objects, which are ubiquitous in JavaScript and React Native development.

The spread operator allows you to easily combine arrays, create copies without mutation, or pass a list of arguments to a function. The rest operator, conversely, helps you collect an indefinite number of arguments into an array within a function definition. Destructuring provides a clean syntax to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into separate variables, reducing boilerplate code.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to write more elegant and efficient JavaScript code, especially when dealing with data structures like arrays and objects. Mastering spread/rest and destructuring will significantly improve your code readability and your ability to manipulate data effectively, which is a key skill for React Native development.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Spread Operator (`...`):** An operator that expands an iterable (like an array or string) into its individual elements. Used for array literals, function calls, and object literals.
*   **Rest Operator (`...`):** An operator that collects an indefinite number of arguments into an array. Used in function parameters or array/object destructuring.
*   **Destructuring Assignment:** A JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
