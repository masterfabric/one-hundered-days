# Day 10: Async JS & TypeScript (I) - Practice

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Code Challenge 1: Typed Asynchronous Fetch:** Create a TypeScript function that simulates fetching user data from a fake API. Define an interface for the `User` object (e.g., `id: number`, `name: string`, `email: string`). The function should return a `Promise<User[]>`.
2.  **Consume with `async/await`:** Use `async/await` to call your typed fetch function and log the fetched users to the console. Implement `try...catch` for error handling.
3.  **Code Challenge 2: Simple Promise Chain with Types:** Create a sequence of two Promises. The first Promise resolves with a `string` after 1 second. The second Promise takes that string, transforms it (e.g., converts to uppercase), and resolves with the new string after another second. Ensure all data types are explicitly defined.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is about bringing together your knowledge of asynchronous JavaScript (`Promises`, `async/await`) and the power of TypeScript's basic types. These challenges are designed to mimic real-world scenarios where you'll fetch data from an API and ensure that the data you receive conforms to a specific structure.

By defining interfaces for your data, TypeScript helps you catch errors early and provides excellent autocompletion in your editor. Combining this with `async/await` makes your data fetching logic both robust and readable. The second challenge reinforces your understanding of Promise chaining and how types flow through asynchronous operations.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have practical experience in writing type-safe asynchronous JavaScript code. You'll be confident in using `Promises`, `async/await`, and basic TypeScript types to fetch and handle data, which is a fundamental skill for building data-driven React Native applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Review of Previous Terms:**
    *   **`Promise`:** An object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
    *   **`async/await`:** Syntactic sugar for writing asynchronous code that looks synchronous.
    *   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
    *   **Interface (TypeScript):** A way to define the shape of an object, enforcing type-checking.
