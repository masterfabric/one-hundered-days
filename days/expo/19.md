# Day 19: React Basics & Hooks - Component Lifecycle (Functional Components Perspective)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Component Lifecycle:** Learn about the different phases a component goes through: mounting, updating, and unmounting.
2.  **Introduce the `useEffect` Hook:** Learn how `useEffect` allows you to perform side effects in functional components.
3.  **Perform Effects on Mount:** Use `useEffect` to run code only once after the initial render (e.g., data fetching).
4.  **Perform Effects on Updates:** Understand how to use `useEffect` to run code when specific dependencies change.
5.  **Implement Cleanup Functions:** Learn how to return a cleanup function from `useEffect` to perform actions when the component unmounts or before the effect re-runs (e.g., clearing timers, unsubscribing).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Every component in React has a lifecycle, a series of phases it goes through from its creation to its destruction. In class components, these phases were managed by specific lifecycle methods. In functional components, the `useEffect` hook is your primary tool for handling these lifecycle events and performing "side effects."

A side effect is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed – for example, data fetching, subscriptions, manually changing the DOM, or setting up event listeners. `useEffect` allows you to tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed and call it later after performing the DOM updates.

You'll learn how to control when `useEffect` runs using its dependency array and how to clean up any resources (like subscriptions or timers) when the component is no longer needed, preventing memory leaks.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to manage side effects and lifecycle events in your functional React components using the `useEffect` hook. You'll understand how to perform actions when a component mounts, updates, or unmounts, which is essential for integrating with external systems, fetching data, and managing resources in your React Native applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Component Lifecycle:** The sequence of phases a component goes through from its creation to its destruction (mounting, updating, unmounting).
*   **`useEffect` Hook:** A React Hook that lets you perform side effects in functional components.
*   **Side Effect:** Any operation that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions, timers).
*   **Cleanup Function:** A function returned by `useEffect` that runs when the component unmounts or before the effect re-runs, used to clean up resources.
