# Day 11: TypeScript (II) & Adv. JS - Interfaces

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Define Interfaces:** Learn how to declare an interface to define the shape of an object.
2.  **Implement Interfaces:** Understand how classes can implement interfaces to ensure they adhere to a specific structure.
3.  **Optional Properties:** Learn how to mark properties as optional within an interface using the `?` symbol.
4.  **Read-only Properties:** Discover how to use the `readonly` keyword to prevent properties from being modified after object creation.
5.  **Extending Interfaces:** Learn how interfaces can extend other interfaces, combining their properties.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Interfaces are a cornerstone of TypeScript, allowing you to define custom types that describe the shape of objects. They act as contracts, ensuring that any object or class that claims to be of a certain interface type will have all the specified properties and methods. This is incredibly powerful for maintaining consistency and catching errors early in your development process.

Today, you'll learn the syntax for defining interfaces, including how to make properties optional or read-only. You'll also see how interfaces can extend each other, promoting code reuse and creating more complex type definitions. This structured approach to data will make your code much more predictable and easier to work with, especially as your React Native applications grow in complexity.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be proficient in using TypeScript interfaces to define clear and robust data structures. You'll be able to enforce type-safety for your objects, leading to fewer runtime errors and more maintainable code. This skill is essential for building scalable and readable React Native applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Interface (TypeScript):** A powerful feature that defines the syntax that any entity must adhere to. It's a contract for the shape of an object.
*   **Optional Property:** A property in an interface that does not necessarily have to be present in an object that implements the interface. Denoted by `?`.
*   **Read-only Property:** A property in an interface that can only be assigned a value when an object is first created. Denoted by `readonly`.
*   **Extending Interfaces:** The ability for one interface to inherit properties and methods from another interface.
