# Day 21: Expo Setup & Core Components - Expo CLI and Project Setup

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Install Expo CLI:** Install the Expo command-line interface globally on your machine.
2.  **Create a New Expo Project:** Use `expo init` to create a new project and choose a blank TypeScript template.
3.  **Explore the Project Structure:** Familiarize yourself with the key files and folders, especially `App.tsx` and `app.json`.
4.  **Run Your First Expo App:** Start the development server and run the app on an emulator/simulator or a physical device using the Expo Go app.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today marks your official entry into the Expo ecosystem, which simplifies React Native development significantly. Expo CLI is your primary tool for creating, developing, and publishing Expo projects. You'll use it to scaffold a new project, which comes with a pre-configured setup, allowing you to focus on writing code rather than wrestling with build configurations.

Understanding the project structure, particularly `App.tsx` (your main component) and `app.json` (your app's configuration file), is crucial. Running your app for the first time, either on an emulator or your phone via Expo Go, will give you a taste of the rapid development cycle that Expo offers, including features like hot reloading.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a fully functional Expo development environment set up. You'll understand the basic structure of an Expo project and be able to create and run your own applications. This is the essential first step to building cross-platform mobile apps with React Native and Expo.
