# Day 24: Expo Setup & Core Components - FlatList

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand `FlatList`:** Learn that `FlatList` is a performant way to render long lists of data in React Native.
2.  **Basic `FlatList` Implementation:** Use `FlatList` with `data` and `renderItem` props to display a simple list of items.
3.  **Use `keyExtractor`:** Understand the importance of `keyExtractor` for performance and proper item identification.
4.  **Add Separators and Headers/Footers:** Explore how to add `ItemSeparatorComponent`, `ListHeaderComponent`, and `ListFooterComponent`.

## 📖 Task Explanations

While `ScrollView` is great for a small number of items, it renders all its children at once, which can lead to performance issues with very long lists. `FlatList` is designed specifically for efficiently rendering long lists of data by only rendering items that are currently visible on the screen, a technique called "virtualization."

Today, you'll learn the core props of `FlatList`: `data` (your array of items), `renderItem` (a function that tells `FlatList` how to render each item), and `keyExtractor` (a function that provides a unique key for each item, crucial for performance). You'll also explore how to add visual elements like separators between items or headers/footers for the entire list.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to display dynamic and performant lists of data in your React Native applications using `FlatList`. You'll understand how to efficiently render large datasets, which is a common requirement for apps displaying feeds, search results, or contact lists.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`FlatList` (React Native):** A component for rendering long lists of data efficiently. It only renders elements that are currently showing on screen, not all the elements at once.
*   **`data` (FlatList prop):** The array of data that `FlatList` will render.
*   **`renderItem` (FlatList prop):** A function that takes an individual item from the `data` array and returns a React component to render for that item.
*   **`keyExtractor` (FlatList prop):** A function that takes an item and its index and returns a unique string identifier for that item. This helps React Native optimize list rendering.
