# Day 8: Async JS & TypeScript (I) - `async` and `await`

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand `async` Functions:** Learn how the `async` keyword transforms a regular function into one that implicitly returns a Promise.
2.  **Use the `await` Keyword:** Learn how `await` can pause the execution of an `async` function until a Promise settles (either resolves or rejects).
3.  **Handle Errors with `try...catch`:** Understand how to use traditional `try...catch` blocks within `async` functions to manage errors from awaited Promises.
4.  **Convert Promise Chains to `async/await`:** Practice refactoring existing Promise-based asynchronous code to use the `async/await` syntax.

## 📖 Task Explanations

While Promises significantly improved asynchronous JavaScript, `async` and `await` take it a step further by allowing you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves almost exactly like synchronous code. This dramatically improves readability and makes complex asynchronous flows much easier to reason about.

When you declare a function as `async`, it signals that the function will perform asynchronous operations and will always return a Promise. Inside an `async` function, you can use the `await` keyword before any Promise-returning expression. `await` will pause the execution of the `async` function until that Promise resolves, and then it will return the resolved value. If the Promise rejects, `await` will throw an error, which you can catch using a standard `try...catch` block.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to write highly readable and maintainable asynchronous JavaScript code using `async` and `await`. This modern approach is widely adopted in React Native and will be a cornerstone of your development workflow, making interactions with APIs and other asynchronous tasks much simpler.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`async`:** A keyword used to define an asynchronous function. An `async` function always returns a Promise.
*   **`await`:** A keyword that can only be used inside an `async` function. It pauses the execution of the `async` function until the Promise it's waiting for settles (resolves or rejects).
*   **`try...catch`:** A JavaScript statement that allows you to test a block of code for errors (`try`) and handle them gracefully (`catch`). Essential for error handling in `async/await`.
