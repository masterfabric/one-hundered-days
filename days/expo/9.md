# Day 9: Async JS & TypeScript (I) - Introduction to TypeScript: Basic Types

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **What is TypeScript?:** Understand the core concept of TypeScript as a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
2.  **Set up TypeScript:** Learn how to install TypeScript and compile `.ts` files into `.js`.
3.  **Basic Type Annotations:** Practice using type annotations for primitive types: `number`, `string`, `boolean`.
4.  **Array and Object Types:** Learn how to define types for arrays (e.g., `number[]`, `Array<string>`) and basic object literals.
5.  **Special Types: `any` and `void`:** Understand when and how to use the `any` type (to opt-out of type-checking) and the `void` type (for functions that don't return a value).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today marks a significant step towards writing more robust and maintainable JavaScript code: the introduction to TypeScript. TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding optional static typing, which means you can define the types of your variables, function parameters, and return values. This allows the TypeScript compiler to catch many common programming errors *before* your code even runs, leading to fewer bugs and a more predictable codebase.

You'll start by understanding the fundamental benefits of TypeScript and then dive into applying basic type annotations to your variables. This includes primitive types, as well as more complex structures like arrays and objects. You'll also learn about `any` for when you need flexibility and `void` for functions that perform actions but don't produce a value.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand the core value proposition of TypeScript and be able to apply basic type annotations to your JavaScript code. This will immediately make your code more readable, self-documenting, and less prone to errors, which is a huge advantage in large-scale applications and team environments, especially in React Native.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language.
*   **Static Typing:** A system where variable types are checked at compile-time, rather than at runtime.
*   **Type Safety:** The extent to which a programming language prevents type errors.
*   **`number` (TypeScript):** Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
*   **`string` (TypeScript):** Represents text data.
*   **`boolean` (TypeScript):** Represents `true` or `false` values.
*   **`array` (TypeScript):** A type that represents a collection of elements of a specific type (e.g., `string[]`).
*   **`object` (TypeScript):** A non-primitive type, used for instances of classes, functions, arrays, etc.
*   **`any` (TypeScript):** A special type that effectively opts out of type-checking. Use with caution.
*   **`void` (TypeScript):** Used for functions that do not return any value.
