# Day 2: JavaScript (ES6+) Fundamentals - Control Flow

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Master `if/else` Statements:** Learn how to use conditional statements to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.
2.  **Explore `for` Loops:** Understand how to use `for` loops to iterate a specific number of times or over elements in an array.
3.  **Work with `while` and `do-while` Loops:** Learn about loops that continue to execute as long as a specified condition remains true.
4.  **Implement `switch` Statements:** Discover how to use `switch` statements for multi-way branching, offering a cleaner alternative to multiple `if/else if` statements.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Control flow is the backbone of any dynamic program. It dictates the order in which your code executes, allowing your applications to respond intelligently to different conditions and perform repetitive tasks efficiently. Today, you'll solidify your understanding of these fundamental constructs in JavaScript.

`if/else` statements are your primary tool for decision-making, enabling your code to take different paths. Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) are essential for automation, letting you process lists of data or repeat actions without writing redundant code. The `switch` statement provides a structured way to handle multiple distinct choices, making your code more readable when dealing with several possible outcomes for a single variable.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be proficient in using JavaScript's control flow mechanisms. You'll be able to write programs that can make decisions, iterate over data, and handle various scenarios, which is crucial for building interactive and responsive applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Control Flow:** The order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.
*   **`if/else` Statement:** A conditional statement that executes a block of code if a specified condition is true, and optionally another block if the condition is false.
*   **`for` Loop:** A control flow statement that executes code repeatedly for a fixed number of times or for each element in a collection.
*   **`while` Loop:** A control flow statement that executes code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
*   **`switch` Statement:** A control flow statement that allows a value to be tested for equality against a list of cases.
