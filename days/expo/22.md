# Day 22: Expo Setup & Core Components - View and Text

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand `View`:** Learn that `View` is the most fundamental component for building UI in React Native, acting as a container for other components.
2.  **Understand `Text`:** Learn that `Text` is the component used to display text in your React Native application.
3.  **Basic Styling:** Apply inline styles and use `StyleSheet.create` to style your `View` and `Text` components.
4.  **Compose Simple Layouts:** Combine `View` and `Text` to create basic UI structures, like a header or a simple card.

## 📖 Task Explanations

In React Native, you don't use HTML `div`s and `p` tags. Instead, you use native components that map directly to platform-specific UI elements. `View` and `Text` are the two most fundamental of these. Think of `View` as a `div` and `Text` as a `p` tag, but they are much more powerful and optimized for mobile performance.

`View` is a container that supports layout with Flexbox, styling, touch handling, and accessibility controls. `Text` is specifically designed for displaying text and supports nesting for different styles within a single block of text. Today, you'll get comfortable using these two core components and applying basic styles to them, which is the starting point for any React Native UI.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create basic UI elements and compose simple layouts using `View` and `Text`. You'll understand how to apply styles to these components, which is essential for building the visual structure of your React Native applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`View` (React Native):** The most fundamental component for building UI. It's a container that supports layout with Flexbox, styling, touch handling, and accessibility controls.
*   **`Text` (React Native):** The component used to display text in a React Native application.
*   **`StyleSheet` (React Native):** An abstraction similar to CSS stylesheets. It provides a way to define styles in a centralized, optimized manner.
