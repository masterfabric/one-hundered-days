# Day 18: React Basics & Hooks - State with `useState` Hook

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand State:** Learn what state is in React and how it differs from props.
2.  **Introduce the `useState` Hook:** Learn how to use the `useState` hook to add state to functional components.
3.  **Declare and Initialize State Variables:** Practice declaring state variables and providing their initial values.
4.  **Update State:** Learn how to use the state updater function returned by `useState` to modify the state, triggering a re-render of the component.
5.  **Manage Multiple State Variables:** Understand how to declare and manage multiple independent state variables within a single component.

## 📖 Task Explanations

While props allow you to pass data down to components, state allows components to manage their own internal data that can change over time. This is what makes your components interactive and dynamic. The `useState` hook, introduced in React 16.8, is the modern way to add state to functional components, replacing the class-based `this.state` and `this.setState`.

When you call `useState`, it returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that value. When you call the updater function, React re-renders the component with the new state. You'll learn how to effectively use this hook to create components that can respond to user interactions, fetch data, or manage any other dynamic information.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create interactive React components that can manage their own internal state. You'll understand the fundamental concept of state in React and how to use the `useState` hook to build dynamic user interfaces. This is a core skill for building any interactive React Native application.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **State (React):** An object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. When the state changes, the component re-renders.
*   **`useState` Hook:** A React Hook that lets you add state to functional components. It returns a stateful value and a function to update it.
*   **Hook (React):** Functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from functional components. `useState` is one such hook.
