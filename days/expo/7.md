# Day 7: Async JS & TypeScript (I) - Working with Promises

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Create a `Promise`:** Learn how to construct a new `Promise` object, passing an executor function with `resolve` and `reject` arguments.
2.  **Consume a `Promise` with `.then()`:** Learn how to attach callbacks to a `Promise` to handle its successful fulfillment.
3.  **Handle Errors with `.catch()`:** Understand how to attach a callback to a `Promise` to handle its rejection (errors).
4.  **Execute Code on Completion with `.finally()`:** Learn how to attach a callback that will be executed regardless of whether the `Promise` was fulfilled or rejected.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Yesterday, you learned about the concept of Promises. Today, you'll get hands-on with creating and consuming them. A `Promise` is essentially a placeholder for a value that will eventually be available. When you create a `Promise`, you define the asynchronous operation and specify what should happen when it succeeds (`resolve`) or fails (`reject`).

To get the result of a `Promise` or handle its errors, you use its instance methods: `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()`. The `.then()` method is for handling successful outcomes, allowing you to chain asynchronous operations. The `.catch()` method is specifically for error handling, providing a clean way to manage failures. Finally, `.finally()` is useful for cleanup operations that need to run regardless of the `Promise`'s outcome, such as hiding a loading spinner.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create and effectively manage asynchronous operations using Promises. You'll understand how to handle both successful results and errors, leading to more robust and readable asynchronous code. This is a fundamental skill for interacting with APIs and other asynchronous tasks in React Native.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`Promise`:** An object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
*   **`resolve`:** A function passed to the `Promise` executor that, when called, changes the `Promise`'s state from pending to fulfilled.
*   **`reject`:** A function passed to the `Promise` executor that, when called, changes the `Promise`'s state from pending to rejected.
*   **`.then()`:** A method of a `Promise` that takes up to two arguments: callback functions for the success and failure cases of the `Promise`.
*   **`.catch()`:** A method of a `Promise` that handles only the rejection (error) case of the `Promise`.
*   **`.finally()`:** A method of a `Promise` that takes a callback function to be executed when the `Promise` is settled (either fulfilled or rejected).
