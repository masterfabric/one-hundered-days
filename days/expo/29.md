# Day 29: Flexbox and Styling - Styling Components and Theming

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Style Custom Components:** Learn how to apply styles to your own reusable React Native components.
2.  **Pass Styles as Props:** Understand how to pass style objects as props to child components, allowing for greater flexibility.
3.  **Conditional Styling:** Learn how to apply styles conditionally based on component props or state.
4.  **Basic Theming Concepts:** Get an introduction to theming, understanding how to define a consistent set of colors, fonts, and spacing for your application.

## 📖 Task Explanations

As your application grows, you'll create many custom components. Today, you'll learn how to effectively style these components, making them reusable and adaptable. Passing styles as props is a powerful pattern that allows parent components to customize the appearance of their children, promoting flexibility without sacrificing reusability.

Conditional styling is essential for creating dynamic UIs that respond to user interactions or data changes. You'll also get a taste of theming, which is about establishing a consistent visual language across your entire application. By defining a theme (e.g., a set of primary and secondary colors, font sizes), you can ensure a cohesive look and feel, and easily switch between different themes (like light and dark mode).

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to style your custom React Native components effectively, pass styles dynamically, and apply conditional styling. You'll also have a basic understanding of theming, which is crucial for building consistent, customizable, and professional-looking mobile applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Theming:** The process of defining a consistent set of visual properties (like colors, fonts, spacing) that can be applied across an entire application to ensure a cohesive look and feel.
*   **Conditional Styling:** Applying different styles to a component based on certain conditions (e.g., if a button is pressed, if an item is selected).
*   **Component Reusability:** The ability to use a component multiple times in different parts of an application, often with different props or styles.
