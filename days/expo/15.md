# Day 15: TypeScript (II) & Adv. JS - Practice

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Code Challenge 1: Typed User Data Transformation:**
    *   Define TypeScript interfaces for `User` (e.g., `id`, `name`, `email`, `isActive`) and `TransformedUser` (e.g., `fullName`, `email`, `status: 'active' | 'inactive'`).
    *   Create an array of `User` objects.
    *   Use `filter` to get only active users.
    *   Use `map` to transform these active users into `TransformedUser` objects.
    *   Log the `TransformedUser` array.
2.  **Code Challenge 2: Inventory Management System (Type-Safe):**
    *   Define a `Product` interface (e.g., `id`, `name`, `price`, `quantity`).
    *   Create an array of `Product` objects.
    *   Use `reduce` to calculate the total value of all products in the inventory.
    *   Use `find` to locate a product by its ID.
    *   Use `some` or `every` to check if any product is out of stock (quantity is 0).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is about integrating your advanced TypeScript knowledge with the powerful array methods you've learned. These challenges are designed to simulate common data processing tasks you'll encounter in real-world applications, especially when dealing with data fetched from APIs or managed locally.

By defining clear interfaces and types, you'll ensure that your data transformations are type-safe, catching potential errors at compile-time. Using `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, `some`, and `every` will allow you to manipulate this data efficiently and declaratively, resulting in clean, readable, and robust code. This practice will significantly boost your confidence in handling complex data flows in a type-safe manner.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have practical experience in building type-safe data processing utilities using advanced TypeScript features and array methods. You'll be able to confidently transform, filter, and aggregate data, which is a crucial skill for developing scalable and maintainable React Native applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Review of Previous Terms:**
    *   **Interface (TypeScript):** Defines the shape of an object.
    *   **Type Alias:** A new name for any type.
    *   **Union Type:** Allows a variable to be one of several types.
    *   **Intersection Type:** Combines multiple types into one.
    *   **`map()`:** Transforms each element in an array.
    *   **`filter()`:** Creates a new array with elements that pass a test.
    *   **`reduce()`:** Reduces an array to a single value.
    *   **`find()`:** Returns the first element that satisfies a test.
    *   **`some()`:** Checks if at least one element satisfies a test.
    *   **`every()`:** Checks if all elements satisfy a test.
