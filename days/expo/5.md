# Day 5: JavaScript (ES6+) Fundamentals - Review and Practice

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Comprehensive Review:** Revisit all the concepts covered in the past four days: variables (`var`, `let`, `const`), data types, operators, control flow (`if/else`, loops, `switch`), functions (declarations, expressions, arrow functions), spread/rest operators, and destructuring.
2.  **Code Challenge 1: Array Manipulation:** Write a function that takes an array of numbers, filters out even numbers, doubles the remaining odd numbers, and returns a new array.
3.  **Code Challenge 2: Object Transformation:** Write a function that takes an array of objects (e.g., `{ name: 'Alice', age: 30 }`), and returns a new array where each object has an additional property (e.g., `canVote: true/false`).
4.  **Code Challenge 3: Simple Calculator Function:** Create a function that takes two numbers and an operator string (`'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, `'/'`) and returns the result. Use `switch` statements and handle division by zero.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is dedicated to solidifying your JavaScript fundamentals through active review and practical coding challenges. It's crucial to not just passively read but to actively recall and apply the syntax and concepts you've learned. The challenges are designed to make you combine multiple concepts, such as control flow with array methods, or object manipulation with conditional logic.

These exercises mimic common scenarios you'll encounter in real-world development, helping you to think critically and apply your knowledge to solve problems. Don't hesitate to refer back to previous days' notes if you get stuck; the goal is learning and understanding, not memorization.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a much stronger and more confident grasp of modern JavaScript fundamentals. Successfully completing these challenges will demonstrate your ability to apply core concepts to solve practical problems, setting a robust foundation for your upcoming React Native journey.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Review of Previous Terms:**
    *   **`let`/`const`:** Modern variable declarations.
    *   **Control Flow:** `if/else`, loops, `switch` for program execution order.
    *   **Arrow Function:** Concise function syntax.
    *   **Spread/Rest Operator:** `...` for expanding/collecting elements.
    *   **Destructuring:** Unpacking values from arrays/objects.
