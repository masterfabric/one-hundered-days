# Day 25: Expo Setup & Core Components - Practice Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a simple mobile application that displays a list of items, such as a contact list, a product catalog, or a social media feed.
2.  **Component Usage:** Utilize `View`, `Text`, `ScrollView` (if needed for static content), and `FlatList` (for dynamic lists).
3.  **Data Simulation:** Create a mock array of data (e.g., an array of user objects with `name`, `phone`, `email` for a contact list).
4.  **Item Rendering:** Use `FlatList` to render each item from your mock data, displaying relevant information using `Text` components within `View` containers.
5.  **Basic Styling:** Apply some basic styling to make your list visually appealing.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is your opportunity to combine the core Expo components you've learned (`View`, `Text`, `ScrollView`, `FlatList`) into a practical application. Building a list-based UI is a very common task in mobile development, and this project will solidify your understanding of how to efficiently display dynamic data.

You'll need to think about how to structure your data, how to pass it to `FlatList`, and how to render each individual item. Pay attention to the `keyExtractor` for performance. This project will give you a hands-on feel for building a real-world React Native UI with Expo.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have practical experience in building a basic React Native UI that displays a dynamic list of items. You'll be comfortable using `FlatList` for efficient list rendering and combining core components to create a functional and visually appealing interface. This project is a significant step in your journey to becoming a proficient React Native developer.
