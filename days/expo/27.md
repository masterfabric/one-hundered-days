# Day 27: Flexbox and Styling - Advanced Flexbox

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand `flex` Property:** Learn how the `flex` property on a child item controls its ability to grow or shrink to fill available space.
2.  **Use `alignSelf`:** Learn how `alignSelf` allows an individual flex item to override the `alignItems` property set on its parent container.
3.  **Explore `flexWrap`:** Understand how `flexWrap` controls whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines.
4.  **Understand `alignContent`:** Learn how `alignContent` aligns a flex container's lines within the flex container when there is extra space in the cross-axis and `flexWrap` is set to `wrap`.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Building on yesterday's Flexbox fundamentals, today you'll dive into more advanced properties that give you even finer control over your layouts. The `flex` property is crucial for creating responsive designs, allowing items to dynamically grow or shrink based on available space. This is key for making your UI adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and orientations.

`alignSelf` provides an escape hatch for individual items, letting them break away from the parent's `alignItems` rule. `flexWrap` is essential when you have many items that might overflow a single line, allowing them to wrap onto the next. Finally, `alignContent` helps distribute space between these wrapped lines, similar to how `justifyContent` works on the main axis.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create highly flexible and adaptive layouts using advanced Flexbox properties. You'll understand how to make your UI truly responsive, ensuring it looks great and functions well across a wide range of devices and screen dimensions. This mastery of Flexbox is a cornerstone of professional React Native development.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`flex` (Flexbox):** A shorthand property that sets the `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` of a flex item. It controls how a flex item will grow or shrink to fill the available space.
*   **`alignSelf` (Flexbox):** Overrides the `alignItems` value for a single flex item, allowing it to be aligned differently from the other flex items in the container.
*   **`flexWrap` (Flexbox):** Controls whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines.
*   **`alignContent` (Flexbox):** Aligns a flex container's lines within the flex container when there is extra space in the cross-axis and `flexWrap` is set to `wrap`.
