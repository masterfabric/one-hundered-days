# Day 16: React Basics & Hooks - Introduction to React and Functional Components

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **What is React?:** Understand the core concepts of React as a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2.  **Introduction to JSX:** Learn about JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.
3.  **Create Your First Functional Component:** Learn how to define a simple functional component in React.
4.  **Render Components:** Understand how to render your React components to the DOM (or in our case, to the native UI in React Native).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you're taking a significant leap into the world of modern front-end development with React. React is a declarative, component-based library that makes building complex user interfaces much more manageable. Instead of directly manipulating the DOM, you describe what your UI should look like, and React takes care of updating it efficiently.

JSX is a key part of React. It allows you to write UI elements using a syntax that looks very similar to HTML directly within your JavaScript code. This makes it incredibly intuitive to define the structure of your components. You'll start by creating simple functional components, which are JavaScript functions that return JSX, and learn how to render them to the screen.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a foundational understanding of React's core principles and its component-based architecture. You'll be able to create basic functional components and render them, which is the absolute first step towards building any React or React Native application.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
*   **JSX (JavaScript XML):** A syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code directly within your JavaScript files.
*   **Functional Component:** A JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns React elements (JSX) to describe the UI.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** A design paradigm where the UI is broken down into independent, reusable pieces called components.
