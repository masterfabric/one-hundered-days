# Day 26: Flexbox and Styling - Introduction to Flexbox

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **What is Flexbox?:** Understand Flexbox as a one-dimensional layout system for arranging items in rows or columns.
2.  **`flexDirection`:** Learn how to use `flexDirection` to define the main axis of your layout (row or column).
3.  **`justifyContent`:** Learn how to distribute space between and around items along the main axis using `justifyContent`.
4.  **`alignItems`:** Learn how to align items along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis) using `alignItems`.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Flexbox is the cornerstone of layout in React Native. It provides a powerful and efficient way to arrange, align, and distribute space among items within a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. Unlike traditional CSS Flexbox, React Native's Flexbox is always enabled by default for `View` components, making it the standard for building layouts.

Today, you'll grasp the fundamental concepts: `flexDirection` determines if your items flow horizontally (`row`) or vertically (`column`). `justifyContent` handles how items are spaced out along that main axis, while `alignItems` controls their alignment along the perpendicular cross axis. Mastering these properties is crucial for building any responsive UI in React Native.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a solid understanding of Flexbox fundamentals. You'll be able to arrange components in rows and columns, control their spacing, and align them precisely. This foundational knowledge is essential for building any layout in React Native, from simple to complex.
