# Day 14: TypeScript (II) & Adv. JS - Advanced Array Methods: `forEach`, `find`, `some`, `every`

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand `Array.prototype.forEach()`:** Learn how to iterate over each element in an array to perform an action, without creating a new array.
2.  **Understand `Array.prototype.find()`:** Learn how to find the first element in an array that satisfies a provided testing function.
3.  **Understand `Array.prototype.some()`:** Learn how to check if at least one element in the array satisfies a provided testing function.
4.  **Understand `Array.prototype.every()`:** Learn how to check if all elements in the array satisfy a provided testing function.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Building on yesterday's array methods, today you'll expand your toolkit with `forEach`, `find`, `some`, and `every`. These methods provide powerful and declarative ways to interact with arrays, making your code cleaner and more expressive than traditional `for` loops.

`forEach` is ideal when you simply need to perform an action for each element, like logging them to the console. `find` is perfect for quickly locating a specific element based on a condition. `some` and `every` are excellent for checking conditions across an entire array, determining if at least one element or all elements, respectively, meet certain criteria. These methods are frequently used in React Native for data processing and UI rendering logic.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a comprehensive understanding of advanced array manipulation techniques in JavaScript. You'll be able to efficiently iterate, search, and check conditions within arrays, leading to more readable, maintainable, and performant code. These skills are invaluable for handling data in any modern JavaScript application, including React Native.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`forEach()`:** An array method that executes a provided function once for each array element.
*   **`find()`:** An array method that returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise, `undefined` is returned.
*   **`some()`:** An array method that tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.
*   **`every()`:** An array method that tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.
