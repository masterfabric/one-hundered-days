# Day 17: React Basics & Hooks - Props

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Props:** Learn what props (short for properties) are and how they are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
2.  **Pass Props to a Component:** Practice passing various types of data (strings, numbers, booleans, objects, functions) as props.
3.  **Receive and Use Props in a Child Component:** Learn how to access and use the props passed to a functional component.
4.  **Type-Check Props with TypeScript:** Learn how to define the expected types of your props using TypeScript interfaces, ensuring type-safety.
5.  **Set Default Props:** Understand how to provide default values for props that are not explicitly passed by the parent component.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Props are the primary mechanism for communication between components in React. They allow you to make your components dynamic and reusable. Think of props as arguments you pass to a function; in this case, the function is your component, and the arguments are the data it needs to render.

Today, you'll get hands-on with passing data down the component tree. You'll also integrate your TypeScript knowledge by defining `Prop Types` using interfaces. This is a crucial step for building robust React applications, as it helps catch errors related to incorrect data types being passed to components. Setting default props provides a fallback for when a parent component doesn't supply a particular prop, making your components more resilient.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create highly reusable and configurable React components by effectively using props. You'll understand how to pass data down the component tree and how to ensure type-safety for your component inputs using TypeScript, which is fundamental for building scalable React Native applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Props (Properties):** An object that contains data passed from a parent component to a child component. Props are read-only.
*   **Prop Types (TypeScript):** Using TypeScript interfaces to define the expected types of props that a component should receive, enabling static type-checking.
*   **Default Props:** Default values assigned to props that are not explicitly provided by the parent component.
