# Scenario 16: Tagging Releases

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Create a tag:** Use the `git tag` command to create a new tag for a specific commit.
2.  **Push the tag:** Push the new tag to the remote repository so that others can see it.
3.  **Explore tag options:** Learn how to create annotated tags that include more information.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Tags are used to mark specific points in your repository's history as being important. Typically, people use this functionality to mark release points (e.g., `v1.0`). Tags are like a branch that doesn't move. Once a tag is created, it stays on that commit forever, making it easy to find and check out specific versions of your project in the future.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn how to create permanent markers in your project's history. This is the standard way to handle versioning in Git and is essential for managing releases.
