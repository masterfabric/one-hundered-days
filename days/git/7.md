# Scenario 7: Resolving Merge Conflicts

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Create a merge conflict:** Intentionally create a situation where Git cannot automatically merge two branches.
2.  **Identify the conflict:** Use `git status` to see that there is a merge conflict.
3.  **Resolve the conflict:** Open the conflicting file, manually edit it to resolve the differences, and save the file.
4.  **Complete the merge:** Use `git add` to mark the conflict as resolved, and then `git commit` to finish the merge.

## 📖 Task Explanations

A merge conflict occurs when you try to merge two branches that have conflicting changes. This is a normal part of working with Git, and it's important to know how to handle it. When a conflict occurs, Git will stop the merge and ask you to resolve the conflict manually. You will need to edit the conflicting files to decide which changes to keep.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn how to confidently handle merge conflicts, which is an essential skill for working in a team. You will no longer be afraid of seeing the dreaded "merge conflict" message.
