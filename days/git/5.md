# Scenario 5: Branching

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Create a new branch:** Use the `git branch` command to create a new branch.
2.  **Switch to the new branch:** Use `git checkout` or `git switch` to start working on the new branch.
3.  **Make a commit:** Create a new commit on the new branch.
4.  **Visualize the history:** Use `git log --graph` to see how the commit history has diverged.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Branches are one of the most powerful features of Git. They allow you to create an independent line of development. This means you can work on a new feature or a bug fix without affecting the main codebase. When you are done, you can merge your changes back into the main branch. This workflow is essential for collaboration and for managing complex projects.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn how to work on different features in parallel without interfering with each other. This is a fundamental skill for any developer working on a team.
