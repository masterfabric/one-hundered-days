# Scenario 12: Undoing Changes

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Unstage a file:** Use `git reset` to remove a file from the staging area.
2.  **Undo a commit:** Use `git reset` to go back to a previous commit, discarding the changes from the more recent commits.
3.  **Revert a commit:** Use `git revert` to create a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Everyone makes mistakes. Knowing how to undo them is an important Git skill. There are two main ways to undo changes in Git: `git reset` and `git revert`. `git reset` is used to move the current branch to a different commit, which can be used to unstage files or to completely remove commits from the history. `git revert` creates a new commit that is the opposite of a previous commit. This is a safer way to undo changes that have already been shared with others.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn how to safely undo your mistakes in Git. You will understand the difference between `reset` and `revert` and when it is appropriate to use each.
