# Scenario 6: Merging

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Switch to the main branch:** Go back to your main branch using `git checkout main`.
2.  **Merge the feature branch:** Use the `git merge` command to integrate the changes from your feature branch into the main branch.
3.  **Verify the merge:** Check the log to see the new merge commit and confirm that the changes are now present in the main branch.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Once you have finished working on a feature in a separate branch, you will want to integrate it back into your main codebase. This is done with the `git merge` command. Merging takes the changes from one branch and applies them to another. In most cases, Git will be able to do this automatically.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn how to combine work from different branches, which is a core part of the Git workflow. This allows you to integrate new features and bug fixes into your main project.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers
