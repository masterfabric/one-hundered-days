# Scenario 14: Cherry-Picking

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Identify a commit:** Find a specific commit on one branch that you want to apply to another.
2.  **Cherry-pick the commit:** Use the `git cherry-pick` command to apply that single commit to your current branch.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Sometimes, you don't want to merge an entire branch into another, but you do want to pick out a single commit from that branch and apply it to your current branch. This is what `git cherry-pick` is for. It allows you to take any commit from anywhere in your repository and apply it to your current location. This can be useful for backporting a bug fix to a release branch, for example.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn how to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. This is a useful tool for when you need to move a small change between branches without the overhead of a full merge.
