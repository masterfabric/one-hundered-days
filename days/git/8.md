# Scenario 8: Connecting to a Remote

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Create a remote repository:** Go to a service like GitHub and create a new, empty repository.
2.  **Connect your local repository:** Use the `git remote add` command to link your local repository to the remote one.
3.  **Verify the connection:** Use `git remote -v` to see that the remote repository has been successfully added.

## 📖 Task Explanations

A remote repository is a version of your project that is hosted on the internet or a network. When you are working on a team, you will use a remote repository to share your code with others. It also serves as a backup of your work. The `git remote add` command creates a connection between your local repository and the remote one.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn how to connect your local project to the outside world. This is the first step towards collaborating with other developers and sharing your code.
