# Scenario 15: Stashing Changes

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Make some changes:** Modify some files in your working directory.
2.  **Stash the changes:** Use `git stash` to save your changes without committing them.
3.  **Switch context:** Switch to a different branch to work on something else.
4.  **Re-apply the changes:** Come back to your original branch and use `git stash pop` to get your stashed changes back.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Sometimes you are in the middle of working on something, but you need to suddenly switch to a different task. You don't want to commit your half-finished work, but you also don't want to lose it. This is where `git stash` comes in. It allows you to save your local modifications away and revert the working directory to match the last commit. You can then re-apply your stashed changes later.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn how to safely set aside your work-in-progress so that you can switch to a different task. This is a great tool for managing your workflow and keeping your commit history clean.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`git stash`:** A command that temporarily saves your uncommitted changes.
*   **`git stash pop`:** A command that re-applies your most recently stashed changes and removes them from the stash.
