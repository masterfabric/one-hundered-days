## 📖 Task Explanations

When you are working on a team, other people will be pushing their changes to the remote repository. To keep your local repository up-to-date, you need to periodically download these changes. The `git pull` command fetches the latest changes from the remote and merges them into your current local branch. This ensures that you are always working with the most recent version of the project.
