# Scenario 2: Staging & Committing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Create a new file:** Add a new file to your repository.
2.  **Stage the file:** Use the `git add` command to add the file to the staging area.
3.  **Commit the changes:** Use the `git commit` command to save the staged changes to the repository's history.
4.  **Write a good commit message:** Practice writing a clear and concise commit message.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Saving changes in Git is a two-step process. First, you add the changes you want to save to the "staging area" using `git add`. This allows you to group related changes together. Second, you commit the staged changes to the repository's history with `git commit`. This creates a permanent snapshot of your project at that point in time.
