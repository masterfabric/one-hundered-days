# Scenario 4: Ignoring Files

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Create a `.gitignore` file:** Create a new file named `.gitignore` in the root of your repository.
2.  **Add patterns to the file:** Add lines to the `.gitignore` file to specify which files and directories Git should ignore.
3.  **Verify the ignored files:** Use `git status` to confirm that the ignored files are no longer showing up as untracked.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Most projects have files or directories that you don't want to save in your repository. These can include log files, build artifacts, or dependency directories (like `node_modules`). The `.gitignore` file is a simple text file where you can list patterns for files and directories that Git should ignore. This helps to keep your repository clean and focused on the important source code.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn how to keep your repository tidy by telling Git to ignore files that don't need to be tracked. This is a crucial skill for working on any real-world project.
