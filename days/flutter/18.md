# Day 18: Flutter Basics & Layout - Stateless Widgets

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand `StatelessWidget`:** Learn what a stateless widget is and when to use one.
2.  **Create a Custom `StatelessWidget`:** Learn how to create your own custom widget by extending the `StatelessWidget` class.
3.  **Understand the `build()` Method:** Learn that the `build()` method is where you define the UI of your widget by composing other widgets.
4.  **Compose Widgets:** Practice creating a simple UI by composing multiple widgets together inside the `build()` method of your custom widget.

## 📖 Task Explanations

In Flutter, widgets are either stateless or stateful. A `StatelessWidget` is a widget that does not have any internal state that can change over time. Its properties are immutable and are passed in from its parent. A stateless widget is only drawn once, when it's first added to the widget tree.

Today, you'll learn how to create your own custom widgets by extending `StatelessWidget`. This is the foundation of building complex UIs in Flutter. You'll learn that the `build()` method is the heart of a widget. It's a function that returns a widget, and it's where you define what your widget looks like by combining other widgets.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create your own custom, reusable widgets. You will understand the concept of composition, which is the process of building complex UIs by combining simpler widgets. This is a fundamental skill for building any Flutter application.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`StatelessWidget`:** A widget that does not require mutable state.
