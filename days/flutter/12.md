# Day 12: Asynchronous Programming - Working with Futures

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Create a `Future`:** Learn how to create a `Future` that completes after a delay.
2.  **Use `.then()`:** Learn how to register a callback that will be executed when a `Future` completes successfully.
3.  **Use `.catchError()`:** Learn how to handle errors that may occur during the execution of a `Future`.
4.  **Use `.whenComplete()`:** Learn how to register a callback that will be executed when a `Future` completes, regardless of whether it was successful or not.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Now that you understand what a `Future` is, it's time to learn how to work with them. A `Future` is an object that represents a potential value, or error, that will be available at some time in the future. You can't get the value of a `Future` directly. Instead, you have to register callbacks on the `Future` that will be executed when the value is ready.

The `.then()` method is used to register a callback that will be executed with the value of the `Future` when it completes successfully. The `.catchError()` method is used to register a callback that will be executed if the `Future` completes with an error. The `.whenComplete()` method is used to register a callback that will be executed when the `Future` completes, for any outcome.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to work with `Future` objects to handle the results of asynchronous operations. You will be able to write code that can respond to both successful and unsuccessful outcomes of an asynchronous operation, which is a crucial skill for building robust applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`Future`:** An object that represents the result of an asynchronous operation.
*   **`.then()`:** A method on a `Future` that registers a callback to be executed when the `Future` completes successfully.
*   **`.catchError()`:** A method on a `Future` that registers a callback to be executed when the `Future` completes with an error.
*   **`.whenComplete()`:** A method on a `Future` that registers a callback to be executed when the `Future` completes, regardless of the outcome.
