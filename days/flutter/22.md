## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand `Stack`:** Learn that the `Stack` widget allows you to place widgets on top of each other.
2.  **Use `Stack` to Overlay Widgets:** Learn how to use the `Stack` widget to create layouts with overlapping elements.
3.  **Use `Positioned` to Control a Child's Position:** Learn how to use the `Positioned` widget to control the position of a child within a `Stack`.

## 📖 Task Explanations

The `Stack` widget is a layout widget that allows you to stack widgets on top of each other. The first widget in the list of children is at the bottom of the stack, and the subsequent children are placed on top of it.

By default, the children of a `Stack` are aligned to the top-left corner. You can use the `Positioned` widget to control the position of a child within the `Stack`. The `Positioned` widget allows you to specify the distance of a child from the top, bottom, left, or right edge of the `Stack`.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create more complex and visually interesting layouts. You will understand how to use the `Stack` widget to overlay widgets on top of each other, which is a common requirement for many UI designs, such as placing text over an image or creating a custom button with an icon and a badge.
