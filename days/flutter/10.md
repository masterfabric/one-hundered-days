# Day 10: Dart Advanced & OOP - Collections

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Collections:** Learn what collections are and why they are so important in programming.
2.  **Work with `List`:** Learn how to create a list, add items to it, remove items from it, and access items by their index.
3.  **Work with `Map`:** Learn how to create a map, add key-value pairs to it, remove pairs, and access values by their key.
4.  **Iterate over Collections:** Learn how to use loops (like `for` and `forEach`) to iterate over the items in a list or the key-value pairs in a map.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Collections are data structures that can hold multiple values. Today, you'll focus on two of the most common collection types in Dart: `List` and `Map`.

A `List` is an ordered collection of items. You can access items in a list by their integer index. Lists are useful when you have a collection of items and the order matters.

A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key in a map must be unique. You can use a key to look up its corresponding value. Maps are useful when you want to associate values with keys, like looking up a word's definition in a dictionary.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to work with collections of data in Dart. You will know how to create and manipulate lists and maps, which are essential data structures for almost any application you will build. You will be able to store, access, and process groups of related data efficiently.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Collection:** A data structure that holds a group of objects.
*   **`List`:** An ordered collection of objects. The same object can appear multiple times in a list.
*   **`Map`:** A collection of key-value pairs. Each key can only appear once in a map.
*   **Index:** The position of an item in a list. The first item in a list has an index of 0.
*   **Key:** The identifier used to access a value in a map.
*   **Value:** The data associated with a key in a map.
