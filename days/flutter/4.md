# Day 4: Dart Fundamentals - Review and Practice

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Review Core Concepts:** Go over your notes and the code you've written for the past three days. Make sure you understand variables, data types, control flow, and null safety.
2.  **Code Challenge 1: FizzBuzz:** Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
3.  **Code Challenge 2: Simple Number Guessing Game:** Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback to the user if their guess is too high or too low.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is about consolidating your knowledge. Reviewing is an active process. Don't just read; try to re-write some of the code from memory. The code challenges are designed to make you think and apply the concepts you've learned in a practical way. FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem that tests your understanding of loops and conditionals. The number guessing game will require you to use loops, conditionals, and user input.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a much stronger grasp of Dart's fundamental concepts. Completing the code challenges will boost your confidence and show you that you can already build simple interactive programs with the knowledge you have.
