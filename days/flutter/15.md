# Day 15: Asynchronous Programming - Practice

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Code Challenge 1: Fake API Fetch:** Write a function that returns a `Future` that completes with a fake user profile (e.g., a `Map` with a name and email) after a 2-second delay. Use `async/await` to call this function and print the user profile.
2.  **Code Challenge 2: Countdown Stream:** Write a function that returns a `Stream` that emits the numbers from 5 down to 1, with a 1-second delay between each number.
3.  **Combine them:** Create a program that starts the countdown stream, and when it finishes, fetches and prints the fake user profile.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is all about putting your asynchronous programming knowledge into practice. The first challenge will test your understanding of `Future` and `async/await`. The second challenge will test your understanding of `Stream`. The third challenge will require you to combine both concepts, which is a common scenario in real-world applications where you might want to perform an action after a stream of events has completed.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a much deeper and more practical understanding of asynchronous programming in Dart. You will be able to confidently use `Future`, `async/await`, and `Stream` to handle asynchronous operations in your programs. This is a critical skill set for building responsive and efficient Flutter applications.
