# Day 1: Dart Fundamentals - Variables and Data Types

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Set up your Dart Development Environment:** Install the Dart SDK and a code editor like VS Code with the Dart extension.
2.  **Create and Run "Hello, World!":** Write a simple program to print "Hello, World!" to the console to verify your setup.
3.  **Learn Variable Declaration:** Understand and use the `var`, `final`, and `const` keywords to declare variables.
4.  **Explore Core Data Types:** Get hands-on with Dart's built-in types: `int` for integers, `double` for floating-point numbers, `String` for text, and `bool` for true/false values.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is about laying the groundwork for your journey into Dart and Flutter. A proper development environment is essential for a smooth learning experience. Installing the Dart SDK gives you the tools to compile and run Dart code, while a good code editor like VS Code with the Dart extension will provide features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging, which will significantly speed up your workflow.

Your "Hello, World!" program is a classic first step in programming. It's a simple but important exercise to confirm that your environment is set up correctly and that you can compile and run a Dart program.

The core of today's lesson is understanding how Dart handles data. In any program, you need to store and manipulate data, and that's where variables come in. You'll learn not just how to store data in variables, but also the important distinction between variables that can be reassigned (`var`) and those that are meant to be constant (`final`, `const`). Using `final` and `const` appropriately is a best practice in Dart that leads to more robust and predictable code.

Finally, you'll get to know the basic building blocks of data in Dart: numbers (`int`, `double`), text (`String`), and boolean values (`bool`). Every piece of data in your application will be composed of these fundamental types.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a functional Dart development setup and a core understanding of how to work with variables and fundamental data types. This knowledge is the bedrock for all future concepts in Dart and Flutter. You'll be able to write simple Dart programs that can store and manipulate basic data.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **SDK (Software Development Kit):** A collection of software development tools in one installable package. The Dart SDK includes the Dart compiler, libraries, and a runtime environment.
*   **Variable:** A named storage location in a computer's memory that holds a value. In Dart, variables are declared with keywords like `var`, `final`, or `const`.
*   **Data Type:** A classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold. Examples include `int` for integers and `String` for text.
*   **`var`:** A keyword in Dart used to declare a variable whose type is inferred by the compiler and whose value can be reassigned.
*   **`final`:** A keyword in Dart used to declare a variable that can only be set once. It's a runtime constant.
*   **`const`:** A keyword in Dart used to declare a variable that is a compile-time constant. This means its value must be known at the time the code is compiled.
