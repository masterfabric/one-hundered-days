# Day 21: Comprehensive Layout - Row and Column

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand `Row` and `Column`:** Learn that `Row` and `Column` are the two most basic layout widgets in Flutter.
2.  **Use `Row` to Arrange Widgets Horizontally:** Learn how to use the `Row` widget to arrange a list of child widgets in a horizontal line.
3.  **Use `Column` to Arrange Widgets Vertically:** Learn how to use the `Column` widget to arrange a list of child widgets in a vertical line.
4.  **Control Alignment:** Learn how to use the `mainAxisAlignment` and `crossAxisAlignment` properties to control how the children of a `Row` or `Column` are aligned.

## 📖 Task Explanations

`Row` and `Column` are the workhorses of layout in Flutter. They allow you to arrange widgets in a simple, linear fashion. `Row` arranges its children horizontally, and `Column` arranges them vertically.

Today, you'll learn how to use these two widgets to create basic layouts. You'll also learn about the `mainAxisAlignment` and `crossAxisAlignment` properties, which are crucial for controlling the alignment of the children within a `Row` or `Column`. The main axis is the direction in which the widget scrolls (horizontal for a `Row`, vertical for a `Column`), and the cross axis is the other direction.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create basic but essential layouts in Flutter. You will understand how to arrange widgets horizontally and vertically, and how to control their alignment. This is a fundamental skill for building any UI in Flutter.
