# Day 14: Asynchronous Programming - Introduction to Streams

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Streams:** Learn what a `Stream` is and how it differs from a `Future`.
2.  **Create a `Stream`:** Learn how to create a simple `Stream` that emits a sequence of values.
3.  **Listen to a `Stream`:** Learn how to use the `listen()` method to subscribe to a `Stream` and receive its events.
4.  **Manage a `StreamSubscription`:** Understand that `listen()` returns a `StreamSubscription` object that you can use to pause, resume, or cancel the subscription.

## 📖 Task Explanations

A `Future` represents a single value that will be available in the future. A `Stream`, on the other hand, represents a sequence of asynchronous events. You can think of a `Stream` as an asynchronous `Iterable`. Instead of getting a single value, you can listen to a `Stream` and receive a series of values over time.

Streams are used for many things in Dart and Flutter, such as handling user input events, reading data from a file, or receiving data from a WebSocket. Today, you'll learn the basics of how to create and listen to streams.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to work with sequences of asynchronous events using `Stream`. You will be able to create and subscribe to streams, which is a fundamental skill for building reactive applications that can respond to events as they happen.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`Stream`:** A sequence of asynchronous events. It's like an asynchronous `Iterable`.
*   **`StreamSubscription`:** An object that represents a subscription to a `Stream`. It can be used to manage the subscription (e.g., pause, resume, cancel).
*   **`listen()`:** A method on a `Stream` that you call to subscribe to the stream's events.
