# Day 29: User Input & Forms - Practice Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a simple login or registration form.
2.  **Form Fields:** Include at least two `TextFormField` widgets (e.g., for email and password).
3.  **Validation:** Implement validation for each field (e.g., email format, password length).
4.  **Submit Button:** Add a button that, when pressed, triggers the form validation and displays a success message or error messages.
5.  **Gesture Handling:** Make the entire form area dismiss the keyboard when tapped outside of a `TextField`.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll combine your knowledge of `TextField`, `Form`, validation, and `GestureDetector` to build a common UI component: a login or registration form. This is a practical exercise that will solidify your understanding of how to handle user input in a structured and robust way.

You'll need to think about how to manage the form's state, how to display validation errors to the user, and how to make the form user-friendly (e.g., by dismissing the keyboard when the user taps outside the input fields).

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have practical experience in building interactive forms with validation and gesture handling. You will be able to create forms that are both functional and user-friendly, which is a fundamental skill for almost any application that requires user interaction.
