# Day 30: Project - Simple Calculator (UI Version)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Rebuild the command-line calculator you created on Day 5 as a full-fledged Flutter UI application.
2.  **UI Design:** Design a calculator interface with buttons for numbers (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), an equals button, and a display area for input and results.
3.  **User Input:** Use `GestureDetector` or `InkWell` on the buttons to capture user input.
4.  **Logic Integration:** Integrate the calculation logic you developed on Day 5 into your Flutter app.
5.  **Display Results:** Update the display area to show the current input and the calculated results.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is a significant milestone! You'll be taking a functional command-line application and transforming it into a graphical user interface (GUI) application using Flutter. This project will challenge you to apply everything you've learned about layout, user input (`TextField` for display, `GestureDetector` for button presses), and basic state management.

Think about how to manage the calculator's state (the current input, the stored number, the selected operator). This will likely involve a `StatefulWidget` and `setState()` to update the display. This project is a fantastic way to see how your Dart fundamentals translate into a visually interactive application.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have successfully translated a command-line application into a modern Flutter UI. You will have a much deeper understanding of how to combine layout, user input, and state management to create a functional and interactive application. This project will be a strong addition to your portfolio and demonstrate your ability to build practical Flutter apps.
