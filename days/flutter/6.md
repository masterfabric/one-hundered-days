# Day 6: Dart Advanced & OOP - Introduction to Classes

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Learn the basic principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
2.  **Define a `class`:** Learn the syntax for creating a class in Dart.
3.  **Create Objects (Instances):** Understand how to create an instance of a class.
4.  **Add Properties and Methods:** Learn how to add variables (properties) and functions (methods) to a class.
5.  **Work with Constructors:** Learn how to create constructors to initialize the properties of an object when it's created.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you're moving beyond simple data types and learning how to create your own! Object-Oriented Programming is a powerful paradigm for organizing your code. Instead of just having loose functions and variables, you can group related data and behavior together into "objects." A `class` is the blueprint for creating these objects. You'll learn how to define the properties (data) and methods (behavior) of your objects, and how to initialize them with constructors.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to think about your code in terms of objects. You will be able to create your own custom types by defining classes, which is a fundamental skill for building any non-trivial application. This will allow you to write more organized, modular, and reusable code.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):** A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
*   **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of properties and methods that are common to all objects of that type.
*   **Object (Instance):** A concrete occurrence of a class. If you have a `Car` class, a specific car like a "red Tesla" would be an object or instance of that class.
*   **Property:** A variable that belongs to an object (e.g., `color` could be a property of a `Car` object).
*   **Method:** A function that belongs to an object (e.g., `drive()` could be a method of a `Car` object).
*   **Constructor:** A special method for creating and initializing an object instance of a class.
