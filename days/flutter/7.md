# Day 7: Dart Advanced & OOP - Inheritance

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Inheritance:** Learn what inheritance is and why it's a powerful feature of OOP.
2.  **Use the `extends` Keyword:** Learn how to create a new class (subclass) that inherits from an existing class (superclass).
3.  **Use the `super` Keyword:** Understand how to call the constructor of the superclass from the subclass.
4.  **Override Methods:** Learn how to provide a new implementation for a method that is inherited from the superclass using the `@override` annotation.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Inheritance is a way to form relationships between classes. It allows you to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. The new class (the "subclass") inherits the properties and methods of the existing class (the "superclass"). This is a great way to reuse code. For example, you could have a `Vehicle` class with properties like `speed` and methods like `drive()`. Then you could create a `Car` class that `extends` `Vehicle` and adds its own specific properties and methods, like `numberOfDoors`.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create hierarchies of related classes, which is a powerful way to organize your code and reuse it effectively. You will understand how to extend existing classes and customize their behavior, which is a core concept in building complex applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Inheritance:** A mechanism in OOP where a new class (subclass) derives properties and methods from an existing class (superclass).
*   **Subclass:** A class that inherits from another class.
*   **Superclass:** A class that is inherited from.
*   **`extends`:** A keyword in Dart used to create a subclass.
*   **`super`:** A keyword in Dart used to refer to the superclass. It can be used to call the superclass's constructor or methods.
*   **`@override`:** An annotation in Dart that indicates that a method is intended to override a method in a superclass. The compiler will give you an error if you try to override a method that doesn't exist in the superclass.
