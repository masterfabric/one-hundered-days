# Day 9: Dart Advanced & OOP - Mixins

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Mixins:** Learn what a mixin is and how it differs from inheritance and interfaces.
2.  **Create a `mixin`:** Learn the syntax for creating a mixin in Dart.
3.  **Use the `with` Keyword:** Learn how to apply a mixin to a class to add its functionality to the class.
4.  **Explore Use Cases for Mixins:** Understand when it's appropriate to use a mixin, such as when you want to share behavior among unrelated classes.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Mixins are a way of reusing a class’s code in multiple class hierarchies. They are a form of multiple inheritance, but with some restrictions to avoid the complexities of traditional multiple inheritance. A mixin is a class whose methods and properties can be "mixed in" to another class. This is useful when you have a piece of functionality that you want to share among several classes that are not in the same class hierarchy.

For example, you might have a `Logger` mixin that provides a `log()` method. You could then apply this mixin to any class that needs logging functionality, without that class having to inherit from a common `Loggable` superclass.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a new and powerful tool in your OOP toolbox. You will understand how to use mixins to share code between classes in a flexible and maintainable way. This will allow you to write more modular and reusable code.
