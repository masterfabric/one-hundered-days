# Day 26: User Input & Forms - TextField

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand `TextField`:** Learn that `TextField` is the primary widget for getting text input from the user.
2.  **Use `TextField`:** Learn how to add a `TextField` to your Flutter application.
3.  **Control Text with `TextEditingController`:** Learn how to use a `TextEditingController` to programmatically get and set the text in a `TextField`.
4.  **Customize `TextField` Appearance:** Explore properties like `decoration` (e.g., `InputDecoration` for hints, labels, borders) and `keyboardType` (e.g., `TextInputType.emailAddress`, `TextInputType.number`).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Most applications need to get some kind of input from the user, and text input is one of the most common types. The `TextField` widget is your go-to for this. It allows users to type text into your application.

To effectively work with `TextField`, you'll often use a `TextEditingController`. This controller gives you programmatic access to the text within the field, allowing you to read its value, set its value, or listen for changes. You'll also learn how to make your `TextField`s look good and behave appropriately for different types of input using the `decoration` and `keyboardType` properties.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to integrate text input fields into your Flutter applications. You will know how to control the text programmatically and customize the appearance and behavior of your input fields, which is essential for building interactive forms.
