# Day 3: Dart Fundamentals - Null Safety

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Sound Null Safety:** Grasp the concept of null safety and why it's a cornerstone of modern Dart development.
2.  **Work with Nullable Types:** Learn how to declare variables that can hold a `null` value using the `?` operator (e.g., `String? name`).
3.  **Use the Null-aware Operators:** Explore operators like `?.` (null-aware access) and `??` (if-null operator) to work safely with nullable variables.
4.  **Understand the `!` and `late` Keywords:** Learn when to use the `!` operator (null assertion) and the `late` keyword for non-nullable variables that are initialized after their declaration.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Null safety is one of Dart's most powerful features for preventing a common type of error: the null reference exception. Today, you'll dive deep into this concept. You'll learn to explicitly tell the Dart compiler which variables are allowed to be `null` and which are not. This allows the compiler to catch potential errors at compile-time, before your app even runs. You'll learn the syntax for handling nullable types safely, which will make your code more robust and reliable.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to write code that is protected against null reference errors. You will understand how to declare and work with nullable variables safely, leading to more stable and maintainable applications. This is a critical skill for any modern Dart developer.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Null Safety:** A feature in Dart that helps you avoid errors that result from unintentionally trying to use a variable that has a `null` value.
*   **Nullable Type:** A type that can hold a `null` value in addition to its regular values. It's denoted by a `?` after the type name (e.g., `int?`).
*   **Non-nullable Type:** A type that cannot hold a `null` value. By default, all types in Dart are non-nullable.
*   **Null-aware Operators:** Operators that allow you to work with nullable variables in a safe way. For example, `?.` lets you access a property or method on an object only if the object is not `null`.
*   **`late`:** A keyword that tells Dart you will initialize a non-nullable variable before it's used, even though you're not initializing it at the time of declaration.
