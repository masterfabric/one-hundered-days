# Day 8: Dart Advanced & OOP - Abstract Classes and Interfaces

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Abstract Classes:** Learn what an abstract class is and when to use one.
2.  **Create an `abstract class`:** Learn the syntax for creating an abstract class and an abstract method.
3.  **Understand Interfaces:** Learn what an interface is and how it's used to define a contract for a class.
4.  **Use the `implements` Keyword:** Learn how to implement an interface in a class, which forces the class to provide an implementation for all the methods defined in the interface.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is about defining contracts for your classes. An `abstract class` is a class that cannot be instantiated. It's used as a base class for other classes. It can have abstract methods, which are methods that are declared but not implemented. The subclasses are then forced to provide an implementation for these abstract methods.

In Dart, every class implicitly defines an interface. An interface is a contract that a class can choose to fulfill. When a class `implements` an interface, it must provide an implementation for all the methods and properties defined in that interface. This is a powerful way to write decoupled code, where different parts of your application can communicate with each other through a common interface, without needing to know about the specific implementation details.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to define clear contracts for your classes using abstract classes and interfaces. This will allow you to write more flexible, scalable, and maintainable code. You will understand how to enforce a certain structure on your classes, which is essential for building large applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Abstract Class:** A class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed. It can contain abstract methods (methods without a body).
*   **Interface:** A contract that a class can implement. In Dart, any class can be used as an interface. When a class implements an interface, it must provide an implementation for all of the interface's methods and properties.
*   **`implements`:** A keyword in Dart used to implement an interface. A class can implement multiple interfaces.
