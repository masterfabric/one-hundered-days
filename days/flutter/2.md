# Day 2: Dart Fundamentals - Control Flow

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Learn `if/else` Statements:** Understand how to write conditional logic to execute different blocks of code based on a boolean condition.
2.  **Explore `for` Loops:** Learn how to iterate over a sequence of numbers or a collection of items.
3.  **Understand `while` and `do-while` Loops:** Grasp the concept of loops that continue as long as a condition is true.
4.  **Work with `switch/case` Statements:** Learn how to efficiently handle multiple conditions for a single variable.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is about making your programs "smart." Control flow statements allow your program to make decisions and repeat actions. `if/else` statements are the most basic form of decision-making. Loops (`for`, `while`) are fundamental for performing repetitive tasks, such as processing a list of items. `switch/case` statements are a clean way to handle multiple distinct cases for a variable's value, which can be more readable than a long chain of `if/else if` statements.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to write programs that can react to different situations and perform repetitive tasks efficiently. This is a crucial step towards writing complex applications that can handle user input and process data dynamically.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Control Flow:** The order in which a program executes its statements. Control flow statements (like `if`, `for`, `while`) can alter this order.
*   **Conditional Statement:** A statement that performs different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false (e.g., `if/else`).
*   **Loop:** A control flow statement that allows a block of code to be executed repeatedly. `for` and `while` are common types of loops.
*   **Iteration:** A single execution of the code block within a loop.
*   **`switch` statement:** A control flow statement that compares the value of a variable to a list of cases and executes the code block associated with the matching case.
