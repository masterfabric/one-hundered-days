# Day 19: Flutter Basics & Layout - Stateful Widgets

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand `StatefulWidget`:** Learn what a stateful widget is and when to use one.
2.  **Create a Custom `StatefulWidget`:** Learn how to create your own custom stateful widget, which involves creating two classes: a `StatefulWidget` and a `State` object.
3.  **Understand the `State` Object:** Learn that the `State` object is where the mutable state of a stateful widget is held.
4.  **Use `setState()`:** Learn how to use the `setState()` method to notify Flutter that the internal state of a widget has changed, so that Flutter can redraw the widget.
5.  **Explore the Widget Lifecycle:** Get an introduction to the lifecycle of a stateful widget, including the `initState()` and `dispose()` methods.

## 📖 Task Explanations

A `StatefulWidget` is a widget that has mutable state. This means its appearance can change during the lifetime of the widget, for example, in response to user interaction. A `StatefulWidget` is actually composed of two classes: a `StatefulWidget` and a `State` object. The `State` object is where the state of the widget is stored.

When the state of a widget changes, you need to call the `setState()` method. This tells Flutter that the widget is "dirty" and needs to be redrawn. Flutter will then call the `build()` method of the widget to update its appearance.

Today, you'll also get a glimpse into the lifecycle of a stateful widget. You'll learn about the `initState()` method, which is called once when the widget is first created, and the `dispose()` method, which is called when the widget is permanently removed from the widget tree.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create widgets that can change dynamically. You will understand how to manage the internal state of a widget and how to trigger a redraw when the state changes. This is a crucial skill for building interactive applications that can respond to user input.
