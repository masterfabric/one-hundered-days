# Day 20: Flutter Basics & Layout - Practice Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a simple digital business card app.
2.  **UI Design:** The app should display a profile picture, your name, your title, and your contact information (e.g., email and phone number).
3.  **Widget Composition:** Use a combination of `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget` to build the UI.
4.  **Layout:** Use basic layout widgets like `Column`, `Row`, and `Container` to arrange the elements on the screen (we will cover these in more detail soon).
5.  **Interactivity (Optional):** Add a button that, when pressed, changes a piece of information on the card (e.g., toggles the visibility of the phone number). This will require a `StatefulWidget`.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll put your knowledge of stateless and stateful widgets into practice by building a small but complete application. This project will require you to think about how to break down a UI into smaller, reusable widgets. You'll use `StatelessWidget` for the parts of the UI that don't change, and `StatefulWidget` for the parts that do (if you choose to do the optional interactivity part).

This is a great opportunity to solidify your understanding of the concepts you've learned over the past few days. Don't worry if you're not sure how to do everything perfectly. The goal is to try and apply what you've learned and to get a feel for the process of building a Flutter app from scratch.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have practical experience in building a simple Flutter UI. You will have a better understanding of how to use stateless and stateful widgets to create a user interface. This project will serve as a great foundation for the more complex UIs you will be building in the coming days.
