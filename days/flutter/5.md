# Day 5: Project - Simple Command-Line Calculator

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Goal:** Build a simple calculator that runs in the command line.
2.  **Input:** The program should prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
3.  **Processing:** Based on the operator, the program should perform the calculation.
4.  **Output:** The program should print the result to the console.
5.  **Error Handling:** Add basic error handling for invalid input (e.g., division by zero, non-numeric input).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll build your first project! This is where you apply everything you've learned so far. You'll need to get user input from the command line, which is a new skill you'll learn today. You'll use variables to store the numbers and the operator. You'll use control flow (likely a `switch` statement) to decide which calculation to perform. And you'll use `if/else` statements for error handling. This project ties all the fundamental concepts together.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have built a complete, albeit simple, program from scratch. You will have gained practical experience in applying your knowledge to solve a real-world problem. This will give you a great sense of accomplishment and a solid foundation for the more complex projects to come.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **CLI (Command-Line Interface):** A text-based interface used to run programs and interact with a computer. In this project, you'll be reading input from and writing output to the CLI.
*   **User Input:** Data that is provided to a program by the user. In this case, it will be the numbers and the operator.
*   **Error Handling:** The process of anticipating and responding to errors in a program. This is a crucial part of writing robust software.
