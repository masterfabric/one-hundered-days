# Day 17: Flutter Basics & Layout - Your First Flutter App

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Create a New Flutter Project:** Use the `flutter create` command to create a new Flutter project.
2.  **Explore the Project Structure:** Open the project in your code editor and get familiar with the files and directories, especially `main.dart` and `pubspec.yaml`.
3.  **Run the Default App:** Run the default counter application on an emulator or a physical device.
4.  **Make a Small Change:** Try changing the title of the app or the color of the app bar to see your changes reflected in the running app.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll get to see Flutter in action! You'll create a new Flutter project, which comes with a simple counter application. This is a great way to get a feel for the development workflow. You'll learn about the most important files in a Flutter project: `main.dart`, which is the entry point of your application, and `pubspec.yaml`, which is where you manage your project's dependencies.

Running the app and making a small change will give you your first taste of Flutter's hot reload feature, which allows you to see the effect of your changes almost instantly without having to restart the app. This is one of the features that makes Flutter development so fast and enjoyable.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have hands-on experience in creating and running a Flutter application. You will be familiar with the basic structure of a Flutter project and the core development workflow. You will have experienced the power of hot reload, and you will be ready to start building your own custom UIs.
