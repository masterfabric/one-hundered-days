# Day 13: Asynchronous Programming - `async` and `await`

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand `async` and `await`:** Learn how the `async` and `await` keywords provide a declarative way to write asynchronous code.
2.  **Write an `async` function:** Learn how to mark a function as asynchronous using the `async` keyword.
3.  **Use `await` to get a `Future`'s value:** Learn how to use the `await` keyword to pause the execution of an `async` function until a `Future` completes, and then get its value.
4.  **Handle errors with `try/catch`:** Learn how to use `try/catch` blocks to handle errors in `async` functions, just like you would in synchronous code.

## 📖 Task Explanations

While `.then()` and `.catchError()` are powerful, they can sometimes lead to code that is hard to read, especially when you have multiple nested asynchronous operations (a situation sometimes called "callback hell").

`async` and `await` are syntactic sugar that make your asynchronous code look and behave a lot more like synchronous code. When you mark a function with the `async` keyword, you can use the `await` keyword inside it. `await` pauses the execution of the function until the `Future` you're awaiting completes. It then unwraps the value of the `Future` and resumes the function's execution. This allows you to write asynchronous code in a more linear and readable fashion.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to write asynchronous code that is much cleaner, more readable, and easier to reason about. You will be able to use `async` and `await` to write asynchronous code that looks almost identical to synchronous code, which will significantly improve your productivity and the maintainability of your code.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`async`:** A keyword in Dart used to mark a function as asynchronous. An `async` function automatically returns a `Future`.
*   **`await`:** A keyword in Dart that can only be used inside an `async` function. It pauses the execution of the function until the `Future` it's awaiting completes.
